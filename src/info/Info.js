By evaluating model coherence scores, I ensured accurate and meaningful topic identification, providing insights into current social media trends.",

I created this app using Java and the GUI was made with Java Swing. Something else about me is that this is my favourite song!",

I built the movies recommendation algorithm using machine learning tools in Python (NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn) and the front end was created using ReactJS and HTML/CSS. The movie recommendation data was sent from Python to the front end using Flask as I created my own API to accomplish this. Each movie is assigned a sequence of numbers based on their title, genre, and description, and are treated as vectors. The similarities between each movie are computed using the cosine similarity function and assigned a value to be compared altogether.",
