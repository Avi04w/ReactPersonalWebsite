The app will detect any device that you are logged in to and your current playback will be displayed on the player. It makes requests to the Spotify API such as pause, play, skip, etc., using OkHttp and uses the OAuth 2.0 Authentication Code Flow to authenticate users and access their Spotify accounts. I created this app using Java and the GUI was made with Java Swing. Something else about me is that this is my favourite song!",

I built the movies recommendation algorithm using machine learning tools in Python (NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn) and the front end was created using ReactJS and HTML/CSS. The movie recommendation data was sent from Python to the front end using Flask as I created my own API to accomplish this. Each movie is assigned a sequence of numbers based on their title, genre, and description, and are treated as vectors. The similarities between each movie are computed using the cosine similarity function and assigned a value to be compared altogether.",
