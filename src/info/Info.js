I highly recommend using a gradient generator like https://gradientgenerator.paytonpierce.dev/ to generate a pair of colors that you like.
These colors will be used to style your name on the homepage, the background of your picture, and some other accents throughout
the site.

that might not be obvious right off the bat :) I recommend looking at the template example live using "npm start" to get an idea
of what each of the values mean.
